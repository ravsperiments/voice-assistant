## Critical Path (What Blocks What)

**Cannot start these until dependencies complete:**

```
TASK-004 (main.py)
  ↓ Blocked by: TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003
  ↓ (All must be complete)

TASK-006, 007, 008 (provider routing)
  ↓ Blocked by: TASK-005 (Phase 1 testing complete)

TASK-009 (formatting)
  ↓ Blocked by: TASK-006 (LLM routing)

TASK-012 (Phase 2 testing)
  ↓ Blocked by: TASK-006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011
  ↓ (All provider work must be complete)

TASK-018 (final testing)
  ↓ Blocked by: TASK-013, 014, 015, 016, 017
  ↓ (All polish work must be complete)
```

**Can work in parallel:**
- Day 1-2: Tasks 1, 2, 3 (all independent)
- Day 6-8: Tasks 6, 7, 8 (all independent after Phase 1)
- Day 11-12: Tasks 13, 14, 15 (all independent)
- Day 13-14: Tasks 16, 17 (both documentation)

# Create components/conversation.py
# Use template from QUICK_START_GUIDE.md
```

### 3. Track Progress
```bash
# Update tasks.md as you complete tasks
# Mark [ ] as [x] when complete
```

### 4. Test Early, Test Often
```bash
# Don't wait until the end to test
# Test each task as you complete it
# Run Phase 1 integration test before Phase 2
# Run Phase 2 integration test before Phase 3
```

## Files You'll Create/Modify

### New Files (Created in Phase 1-2)
- `components/conversation.py` (~80 lines)
- `.env.example` (Phase 3)
- `PROVIDER_COMPARISON.md` (Phase 3)

### Modified Files
- `main.py` (complete rewrite, ~120 lines)
- `components/llm.py` (+100-150 lines for provider routing)
- `components/stt.py` (+100-150 lines for provider routing + VAD)
- `components/tts.py` (+100-150 lines for provider routing)
- `config.py` (+50 lines for new settings)

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **TASK-004 (main.py loop)** - Core integration point
   - Mitigation: Allocate extra time, test incrementally
2. **Provider API changes** - External dependencies
   - Mitigation: Pin versions, isolate provider code
3. **VAD accuracy** - May need tuning
   - Mitigation: Make threshold configurable, test in various environments

### Low-Risk Areas
1. **TASK-001 (conversation.py)** - Simple data structure
2. **TASK-003 (config updates)** - Configuration only
3. **Documentation tasks** - No code risk

---

## Timeline Estimates

### Conservative (3 weeks)
- Week 1: Phase 1 (slower pace, thorough testing)
- Week 2: Phase 2 (learning cloud APIs, testing)
- Week 3: Phase 3 (polish, documentation, validation)

### Aggressive (2 weeks)
- Days 1-5: Phase 1 (efficient execution)
- Days 6-10: Phase 2 (parallel provider work)
- Days 11-14: Phase 3 (documentation + testing)

### Recommended: 2.5 weeks
- Week 1: Phase 1 + buffer
- Week 2: Phase 2 (full week)
- Week 3 (first half): Phase 3
